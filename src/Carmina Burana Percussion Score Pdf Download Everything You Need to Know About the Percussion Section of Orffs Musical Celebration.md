## History and Background of Carmina Burana
 
Carmina Burana is based on a collection of medieval poems and songs that were found in a manuscript at the Benedictine monastery of Benediktbeuern in Bavaria, Germany. The manuscript dates back to the 11th or 12th century, and contains texts in Latin, Middle High German, Old French, and ProvenÃ§al. The poems and songs deal with various themes such as love, lust, fortune, morality, and satire. Some of them are attributed to famous poets and scholars of the time, such as Walter von der Vogelweide, Heinrich von Morungen, and Peter Abelard. The manuscript was discovered in 1803 by the librarian Johann Christoph von Aretin, who gave it the name Carmina Burana, meaning "Songs of Benediktbeuern".
 
The manuscript was first published in 1847 by Johann Andreas Schmeller, who divided it into six sections: moral and satirical poems, love songs, drinking and gaming songs, spiritual songs, theatrical plays, and supplementary songs. The manuscript attracted the attention of many scholars and musicians who studied its texts and melodies. Among them was Carl Orff, who came across a selection of 24 poems from the manuscript in 1934. He was fascinated by their rhythmic and expressive qualities, and decided to set them to music. He composed Carmina Burana between 1935 and 1936, using a modern Latin translation by Wilhelm Meyer and his own adaptations of the Middle High German texts. He also added two original poems of his own: Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi (Fortune, Empress of the World) and Blanziflor et Helena (Blanchefleur and Helen), which serve as the prologue and epilogue of the work.
  
## Structure and Analysis of Carmina Burana
 
Carmina Burana is divided into five main sections: Primo vere (In Springtime), In taberna (In the Tavern), Cour d'amours (Court of Love), Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi (Fortune, Empress of the World), and Blanziflor et Helena (Blanchefleur and Helen). The work begins and ends with the same movement, O Fortuna (O Fortune), which is a powerful chorus that depicts the capriciousness and unpredictability of fate. The other movements are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with each section having a similar number of movements and a similar structure. For example, Primo vere and Cour d'amours both have seven movements each, with a chorus at the beginning and end, a tenor solo in the middle, and various combinations of soloists and chorus in between. In taberna has six movements, with a baritone solo at the beginning and end, a trio of tenors in the middle, and various combinations of soloists and chorus in between.
 
Orff used a large orchestra for Carmina Burana, but he also employed a reduced instrumentation for some movements to create contrast and variety. He used a wide range of percussion instruments to create rhythmic drive and color. He also used two pianos to provide harmonic support and melodic motifs. He wrote simple but effective melodies for the vocal parts, often using modal scales and ostinato patterns. He also used repetition, variation, imitation, canon, and contrast to create musical coherence and interest. He combined elements of medieval music with modern techniques to create a unique musical style that is both ancient and contemporary.
