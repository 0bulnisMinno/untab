Newtone VST has a sleek and intuitive interface that lets you drag and drop audio files, zoom in and out, adjust pitch and timing, and apply effects.
 
Some of the features of Newtone VST include:
 
- Pitch correction: You can correct the pitch of any audio file using a piano roll or a pitch editor. You can also use presets or create your own scales. Newtone VST can handle monophonic or polyphonic audio, as well as formant shifting and vibrato.

- Slicing: You can slice any audio file into smaller segments and rearrange them as you wish. You can also export the slices as individual files or as a MIDI file.
- Effects: You can apply various effects to your audio files, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, and more. You can also use automation to create dynamic changes in your audio.
