## Example of using the REALbasic HTMLviewer
 
To demonstrate how to use the REALbasic HTMLviewer on Windows 7, we will create a simple web browser application. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new desktop project in REALbasic or Xojo.
2. Add a window to your project and name it "BrowserWindow". Resize it as you like.
3. Add a toolbar to your window and name it "Toolbar". Add four buttons to it and name them "BackButton", "ForwardButton", "ReloadButton", and "StopButton". Set their icons to appropriate images from the library or your own resources.
4. Add an address field to your toolbar and name it "AddressField". Set its width to fill up the remaining space on the toolbar.
5. Add an HTMLviewer to your window and name it "HTMLViewer". Set its left, top, right, and bottom properties to 0 so that it fills up the entire window below the toolbar.
6. Add some code to handle the toolbar buttons. For example 8cf37b1e13
