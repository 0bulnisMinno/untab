## The Basic Concepts of Taiji and Taijiquan
 
Taiji is a philosophical concept that describes the interplay of two opposite but complementary forces: yin and yang. Yin represents the passive, negative, dark, and feminine aspects of nature, while yang represents the active, positive, bright, and masculine aspects. Taiji also implies that everything in the universe is constantly changing and transforming from one state to another.
 
Taijiquan is a martial art that embodies the principles of taiji in its movements and techniques. Taijiquan aims to harmonize the body, mind, and spirit with the natural flow of energy (qi) in the universe. Taijiquan also teaches how to use softness to overcome hardness, how to yield to incoming force and redirect it, how to use circular motions to neutralize linear attacks, and how to use internal power (jing) instead of muscular strength.

## The Purpose of Every Taiji Movement
 
Every movement in Taijiquan has a martial application that can be used for self-defense or combat. However, these applications are not always obvious or easy to understand. Some movements may have multiple applications depending on the situation and the opponent's reaction. Some movements may also have hidden or secret applications that are only revealed to advanced practitioners.
 
To learn the martial applications of Taijiquan, you need to study the original meaning and intention of each posture and its name. You also need to practice with a partner who can provide realistic feedback and resistance. You need to experiment with different angles, distances, timings, and variations of each technique. You need to understand the principles of leverage, balance, centerline, alignment, timing, distance, and sensitivity that govern Taijiquan.
