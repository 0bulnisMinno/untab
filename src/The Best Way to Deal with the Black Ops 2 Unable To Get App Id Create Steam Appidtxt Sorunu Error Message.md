Many players have reported this issue and are looking for a solution. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to fix this problem and enjoy the game.
 
The error message usually means that the game cannot find the steam\_appid.txt file in its folder, which contains the app id of the game.

There are two possible reasons why this file is missing or corrupted: either the game installation is incomplete or damaged, or the antivirus software is blocking or deleting the file.

To fix this issue, you can try the following methods:
 
1. Verify the integrity of game files. This will check if any game files are missing or corrupted and download them again. To do this, right-click on Black Ops 2 in your Steam library, select Properties, go to the Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files. Wait for the process to finish and then try launching the game again.
2. Disable or whitelist your antivirus software. Some antivirus programs may falsely detect the steam\_appid.txt file as a threat and block or delete it. To prevent this, you can either temporarily disable your antivirus software while playing the game, or add the game folder to its exclusion list. Refer to your antivirus software's documentation for more details on how to do this.
3. Create the steam\_appid.txt file manually. If none of the above methods work, you can try creating the file yourself and placing it in the game folder. To do this, open a text editor such as Notepad and type in 202970, which is the app id of Black Ops 2. Save the file as steam\_appid.txt and copy it to the game folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops II. Then try launching the game again.

We hope that one of these methods helped you fix the error and enjoy Black Ops 2 on Steam. If you have any other questions or issues, please contact Steam Support for further assistance.
