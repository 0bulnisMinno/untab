## Where is Your Mega Airport Cdg Serial Number?
 
Your Mega Airport Cdg serial number is printed on the back of the DVD case or the CD sleeve that came with your product. It is also included in the confirmation email that you received when you purchased the product online. The serial number consists of 20 alphanumeric characters in the format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.
 
If you have lost or damaged your DVD case or CD sleeve, or if you have deleted or misplaced your confirmation email, you can still retrieve your serial number from the Aerosoft website. To do this, you need to log in to your Aerosoft account and go to the "My Products" section. There you will see a list of all the products that you have purchased from Aerosoft, including Mega Airport Cdg.

Your serial number is very important and should be treated as confidential information. It is recommended that you keep a copy of your serial number in a safe place, such as a password manager or a secure cloud storage service.
